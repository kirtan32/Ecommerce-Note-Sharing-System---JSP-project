Problem Definition
-   While studying in the university, students find it too difficult to manage their notes of
    each and every subject. They can't manage to get all the topics related to the
    respective subject date wise and for a particular syllabus. Sometimes they just get
    xerox from the shop nearer to their respective institute with a little bit more price
    and it will be a compromise to those students who share their notes and some others
    just sell it to stationary shops.
    
Project overview
-   Online notes sharing system project is useful to the students to share their work
    towards their subject and to get benefit from this by uploading their work online and
    also to those who are finding the notes for their subject so overall it is beneficial to all
    the students as per their requirements in one place.
-   Users of an online file sharing website who use features like upload, download, share,
    search etc. They can search and get all types of actual material available for their
    respective subjects.
-   From our project we are providing hardworking students to get paid for their work
    without any other interference.
